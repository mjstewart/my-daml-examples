Since daml-sdk-head uses ~/.daml to dump 0.0.0 sdk into, I set the path manually to point to this location for local dev rather than use my nix daml.

PATH=/home/matt/.daml/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home/matt/.zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting:/home/matt/.nix-profile/bin


which is a bit faster if you don’t care about maven artifacts being installed to ~/.m2 (which doesn’t matter if you just want to invoke the SDK tools

daml-sdk-head --skip-jars  


# this needs to be set in your `daml.yaml` on your dummy project that is pointing to your dev sdk build.

```
sdk-version: 0.0.0

parties:
  - Alice
  - Bob
